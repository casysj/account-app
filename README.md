# An account app project

## what is it about

This app automates our wg(Wohngemeindschaft) budget adjustment. 
We share a living allowance, which we each spend on our own and pay back every month.
We have some regular expenses, but we also have some non-regular discretionary expenses, so we pay each other every month.
However, sometimes we forget to do it, so we do it for a few months at a time.

The first problem we want to solve with this project is to make it easier to do the math and calculate the amount of the payment.
There are many other problems that can be solved, but we want to start lightly with the first step

One unique aspect of this project is that we will be actively using AI to develop it.
The first tool we will use will be the free version of ChatGPT.
In some cases, we are willing to use the paid version. For reference, this text is written in English using Deepl.
I will not review the text to make sure it is written as intended, so there may be errors.

## Tech spec

I'm going to use Vue.js for the frontend and PHP Symfony for the backend.
For the frontend, I'm using Vue because it's the technology we use at work, and for the backend, I'm using Laminas, but Symfony seems to be better for lightweight development.
